# Patent Searching Using 'Positive Controls'
Scientists are taught from infancy to run 'positive controls' in their experiments as a way of making sure that a non-result with a test substance isn't a non-result **because the test itself isn't working**.  If, for example, you want to run a test to detect COVID in a blood sample, you need to make sure that a covid-positive blood sample control run through your test gives you a 'COVID DETECTED' result.  Otherwise the non-result is occuring because the test **isn't working right**, not necessarily because the test sample had no COVID in it.

I was trained as a scientist (from infancy) and then became one, after which I became a patent attorney, and I continue to apply the 'positive control' idea in the patenting work I do.  One area where the concept is **critically useful** is in patent searching, which is a perfect example of a situation where you'll almost always get results **regardless** of whether your search is meaningful, something that a 'positive control' for the search can help you overcome.

So imagine you've developed a new imaging compound for MRI usage, and let's say it has some catchy abbreviation like 'paraCEST.'  And let's also say that you have a published patent application on file for your new compound (so that it's searchable in the patent databases).  If you want to find 'similar technology', you'd expect that any 'good' search method you use **should pull up that published patent application come up in the set of search results**.  In other words, that published patent application is really a positive control, and **can be used to give you a handle on how 'good' a search is**.
